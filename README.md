# WiCoSens


# MLDataClassifiers
This module classifies the data that been received from the color sensors.


# MLDataLabeler
This module is used to label the data for supervised learning. The data is captured from multiple sensors such as color(RGBC), IMU.
The data is read from the serial port and processed into different color space (RGB, XYZ, L\*a\*b\*).

The User interface is written using QT. We have used the QT designer to create the ui layout.
